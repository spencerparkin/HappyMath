# HappyMath

This is yet another library of 3D and 2D math classes.  It can do vectors, matrices, quaternions, AABBs, frustums, planes, lines, rays, polygons, polygon meshes, etc.  It also contains an implementation of the GJK algorithm.  Note that it is completely self-contained in that it has no dependencies other than perhaps the standard C++ library.
